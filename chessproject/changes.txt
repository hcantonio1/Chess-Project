new function piece_at_square for chessgame.py
bishops and rooks has incorrect implementation of blockable movement
finally fixed that implementation; consequentially also applies to queens
Next: use square for __init__ of pieces instead of file, rank

Before 20/08/2020
-interactive point and click chess
-pieces can move their normal way if not for blockings
