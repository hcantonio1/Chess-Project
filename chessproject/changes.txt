21/08/2020
Captured pieces removed from the board
Black and White players now take turns
En_passant implemented

ChessGame.on_click piece selection should be modified to be intuitive to the clicker

21/08/2020
Pieces are now initialized using square and not file, rank
All pieces now move and capture normally, except captured pieces are to be eliminated from the board
En passant not yet implemented
Next:
Eliminate captured pieces
Implement en passant

20/08/2020
corrected bottommost spelling
new function piece_at_square for chessgame.py
bishops and rooks has incorrect implementation of blockable movement
finally fixed that implementation; consequentially also applies to queens
Next: use square for __init__ of pieces instead of file, rank

Before 20/08/2020
-interactive point and click chess
-pieces can move their normal way if not for blockings
