# Chess-Project
Chess with basic functionality

The goal of this project is to build a minimally working chess game using pyglet.
That is, the users can click to play the game until checkmate; and they'd have to reopen the window to play again.
Optimization is not a priority, only for fun.

The folowing lines list the possible issues to be created and fixed until the end of the project.
-introduce difference between capturing and moving (required by pawn)
-handle piece capturing
-handle pawn promotion (may require extra work if to allow underpromotion)
-given a position, determine whether a king is on check
-given a position, determine whether a king is on checkmate

Note that this wouldn't be a windows executable file. I've tried converting from .py to .exe but it didn't work.
